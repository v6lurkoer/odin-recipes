    <h2>Simple vegan yakisoba with tofu and veggies</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>30 ml / 2 tbsp all purpose soy sauce (or tamari for GF version)
        <li>10 ml / 2 tsp mushroom soy sauce (optional)*</li>
        <li>15 ml / 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar or maple syrup</li>
        <li>½ tsp garlic powder or small garlic clove, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground up nori**</li>
        <li>2 tsp ketchup or Sriracha (I use half half)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cornflour / cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Remaining ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 dried shiitake mushrooms (optional – feel free to skip if using mushroom soy sauce)</li>
        <li>180 g / 13 oz soba noodles (use 100% buckwheat for GF version)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp high smoke point oil (I use rice bran)</li>
        <li>200 g / 7 oz broccoli, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>2 white cabbage leaves, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>4 baby corns, halved</li>
        <li>½ bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>1 small carrot, sliced thinly</li>
        <li>200 g / 7 oz favourite marinated tofu (I used Japanese-style tofu filets by Taifun), cubed (optional)</li>
        <li>4 spring onions / scallions, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>a large handful of bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted and crushed sesame seeds, to garnish</li>
        <li>Shop-bought shredded and pickled ginger (if you don’t have any, grate some fresh ginger into the sauce)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour boiling water over rinsed dried shiitake, set aside to infuse for as long as you can.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients plus 3 tbsp of water. If skipping mushroom soy sauce, add 2½ tbsp of shittake infused water instead of water and an extra 2 tsp of soy sauce (or tamari). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook your noodles just a couple of minutes less than you would normally. Refresh under a cold tap and set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice the softened mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Heat up a wok on a medium heat. Add the oil and allow it to get really hot – until it starts shimmering.</li>
            <li>Add in broccoli and cabbage – stand back as the oil might splash when you add the veggies in. Stir-fry for 2 minutes on a high-medium heat.</li>
            <li>Next add in baby corn, pepper, carrot, tofu, spring onions and sliced shiitake (if using). Stir-fry for another minute.</li>
            <li>Push all the veggies to the side of the wok and add in the sauce to the bottom of the wok, making sure you give it a good stir before adding to the work or else the cornstarch will be left at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Allow the sauce to bubble for 15-30 seconds and then add the noodles.</li>
            <li>Mix the noodles into the sauce. Then add sprouts and incorporate the noodles into the veggies and tofu.</li>
            <li>Divide between two bowls. Serve topped with toasted sesame seeds and pickled ginger.</li>
        </ol>
