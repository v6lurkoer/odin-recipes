    <h2>Vanilla cupcake with frosting</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>355 ml unsweetened soy milk (or use another non-dairy milk)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>344 g cake flour*</li>
        <li>300 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>0.75 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>113 g melted vegan butter or neutral oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 Recipe Vegan Buttercream Frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 12-cup muffin pan (2 if you have them, if not bake one tray at a time) with paper liners. I usually spray the liners with a little oil as well to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Combine the soy milk and apple cider vinegar in a measuring cup or bowl, give a little stir and set aside for a few minutes to curdle.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt until combined.</li>
        <li>Now pour in the milk/vinegar mixture, melted vegan butter or oil and vanilla. Whisk until well combined. There may be a few small lumps, but you don't want any large lumps in the batter.</li>
        <li>Fill the liners 1/2 full and bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Carefully transfer the cupcakes to a cooling rack, then place new liners in the pan and bake the rest of the cupcakes until you have used all the batter.</li>
        <li>Cool completely, then pipe on Vegan Buttercream Frosting or another frosting of your choosing. Decorate with sprinkles or sliced strawberries. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>Store cupcakes on the counter, covered for up to 4 days (they stay moist!). They also freeze perfectly for up to 3 months, with or without frosting.</li>
    </ol>
